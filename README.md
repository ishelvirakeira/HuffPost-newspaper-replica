This project involved recreating a simplified version of The Huffington Post homepage using HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice building a realistic, content-rich webpage that mirrors a professional news website layout. The project required making the design responsive for different screen sizes using media queries.

<img width="405" height="397" alt="Huffpost" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a374ed0f-4a12-4987-9024-61b2e35ca0ab" />


Tools used were: HTML and CSS.

I learned how to organize content using semantic HTML tags likke <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>. I also gained hands-on experience using float, width percentages, and object-fit to arrange multiple images and text blocks. I learned how to use media queries to make the layout adapt to different (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones), adjusting font sizes, image widths, and navigation structure accordingly. I also focused on how to fiz alignment issues, handle overlapping elements, and refine layout responsiveness.
